# Senlo — Open-Source Email Platform

**Senlo** is an open-source, self-hosted email marketing and transactional email platform. It provides a powerful visual editor, campaign management, and real-time tracking, all in one package that you can control.

## Why Senlo?

Traditional email platforms are often closed-source, expensive, or tied to a specific provider. Senlo breaks these barriers by offering:

- **Full Control**: Host it yourself and own your data.
- **Modern Editor**: A professional drag-and-drop builder (inspired by tools like BeeFree).
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Built-in support for multiple users and projects with strict data isolation.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Use Resend, Mailgun, or any other provider via our flexible integration layer.
- **Transactional Support**: Send triggered emails (receipts, password resets) via a secure API.
